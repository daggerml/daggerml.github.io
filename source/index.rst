DaggerML Documentation
======================

DaggerML is a research platform that enables data scientists and machine
learning engineers to build, train, deploy, and track models with ease. DaggerML
keeps track of what you did and all the associated artifacts, so you can focus
on your work and get the reproducibility for free.


Installation
============

If you don't already have `daggerml-cli` installed in your path, you can install
it with `pip` or `pipx` (e.g. `pipx install daggerml-cli`).

.. tip::

   `pipx` is a tool to install Python applications in isolated environments. It
   is recommended to use `pipx` to install `daggerml-cli` to avoid conflicts with
   other Python packages.


Install the DaggerML python package

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install daggerml
